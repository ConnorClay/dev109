    <h3>My Personal Project</h3>
   <p>for this I am going to show some of the other school projects I have done. for the photo part I am showing a photo I took for a photography course. for the video it is a fake commercial sketch I made with a friend for a science class and for the link I made years ago a website for a coding class called top 500 cheeses. it was stupid but I found it funny back then. I couldn't find the original so I made a recreation of it </p>

     <p> Besides from coding I like to work out, play video games, watch movies, and i've been teaching myself photoshop and primere pro. here are a few fun facts about me, I half 6 siblings, I have fallen off of a waterfall, I used to work for Minecraft where I would go into there offices and playtest unreleased versions. </p>
